This is a project I started based on an idea I came up with some time ago.  We have gradient descent with different learning rates, but I wanted to see what would happen if the learning rate were randomized at every iteration.  So far it has produced promising results, but this makes me wary and so I will continue to study it in different ways to see if it actually does work better than regular gradient descent.
